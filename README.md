Welcome! This is the repository for my personal website.

My website can be found at [wmonahan.com](https://wmonahan.com)

This website is published via Heroku, pulling from GitHub on each commit to the master branch.
As of September 2018, I am updating my site to use NodeJS and Express. Check back for more info at a later date.
